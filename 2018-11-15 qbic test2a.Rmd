## Testing nuclear detection and DNA content analysis

The background-corrected integrated intensity ("total intensity") of nuclei should be proportional to DNA content.

The DNA content in a mixed population of actively cycling cells should form a roughly bimodal distribution representing 1N and 2N populations, with some intermediate cells in S phase.

CellProfiler pipelines were used to perform background correction, identify nuclei using DAPI, and measure intensity of DAPI and other channels in a set of 100 images collected on 11-5-2018.

```{r reading DNA data, echo = FALSE}
qbic_C1DNANuclei <- read_csv("~/Google Drive/User projects/Demis qbic/test 2-3/qbic_C1DNANuclei.csv")
#dnaTotalInt <- qbic_C1DNANuclei$Intensity_IntegratedIntensity_Channel1DNA
dnaTotalInt <- qbic_C1DNANuclei$Intensity_IntegratedIntensity_Channel1DNACorr
dim(dnaTotalInt)
```


Plotting a histogram of the DNA content over all ----- nuclei detected:

```{r DNA content, echo=TRUE} 
# use echo=FALSE to prevent printing code
hist(dnaTotalInt, breaks = (0:50))
```

This shows that there is a roughly bimodal distribution with peaks ~ 12 and ~ 24, with tails on either side.


```{r proportion of outliers}
low_vals <- mean(dnaTotalInt < 1) * 100
high_vals <- mean(dnaTotalInt > 30) * 100
central_vals <- mean(dnaTotalInt > 1 & dnaTotalInt < 30) * 100

cat(central_vals, "% of the values are between 1 and 30; ",low_vals,"% <1; and",high_vals,"% >30")
```

Ultimately we would like to see an inverted horseshoe-type plot of EdU (showing S phase cells) vs. DNA content where the cells incorporating EdU are primarily those between the 2 peaks.

Generating the other dimension of the plot from the corrected mean intensity from Channel 2, EdU:
```{r reading EdU data}
#EdUMeanInt <- qbic_C1DNANuclei$Intensity_MeanIntensity_Channel2EdU
EdUMeanInt <- qbic_C1DNANuclei$Intensity_MeanIntensity_Channel2EdUCorr
hist(EdUMeanInt)
plot(x = dnaTotalInt, y = EdUMeanInt) # basic scatter plot
```



### Are nuclei detected properly?

Several images were selected at random and the image of detected objects was compared with the original data. 

![Detection of nuclei](/Users/confocal/github_theresaswayne/cellprofiler/detection\ Montage.png)
 
False positives (non-cells counted as objects) and false negatives (cells not included in the object map) were scored manually.

```{r reading quality control data, results = 'asis'}
qbic_check <- read_csv("~/github_theresaswayne/cellprofiler/2018-11-15 qbic test 2a.csv")
kable(qbic_check[,(1:5)])
total_cells <- sum(qbic_check$`Cells detected by CP`)
false_pos <- 100 * sum(qbic_check$`False positives`)/total_cells
false_neg <- 100 * sum(qbic_check$`False negatives`)/total_cells
cat("Out of",total_cells,"cells detected, there were",false_pos,"% false positives and",false_neg,"% false negatives.")
```

## Question: What to do with apparent clumps? 

Some DAPI structures appear to have multiple lobes. Are these multi-lobed nuclei, mitotic cells, or actually multiple cells close together?

<!-- TODO: Insert images here of specific examples of ambiguous multiple cells -->


If needed, we can modify the object detection to split objects by shape.

## Summary

* Time of processing with CellProfiler is < 10 min per 100 images for illumination correction and the same for object detection.
* Nuclei are detected well in this system. There are virtually no false negatives.
* Some bright debris results in false positives, about 2%.
* We need to decide if some objects should be split or if they are actually single nuclei.
