Image,Cells detected by CP,False positives,False negatives,Cells detected by Analyze Particles,Notes
89,14,,0,9,group of 3 round objects probably is 2 cells but groups of 2 directly adjacent may be mitotic
51,20,,0,11,
68,22,,0,16,at least 1 false pos = thread like thing
85,14,,0,9,analyze particles actually gives 625 for some reason… 1st cell gets measured 616 times. One cell is counted but actually seems to be touching edge.
31,18,,0,13,
65,3,,0,3,at least 1 false pos
36,19,,0,9,clumpy thing at lower center is at least 2 false pos based on analyze particles
45,47,47,0,39,just junk -- mask looks like the image was auto contrasted
13,21,,0,11,
86,15,,0,8,
