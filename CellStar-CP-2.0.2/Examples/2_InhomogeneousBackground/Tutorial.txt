EXAMPLE USAGE 2
INHOMOGENEOUS BACKGROUND AND STRONG EDGES AND DARK CELL INTERIOR:

1. Input imagery features:
    As in Example Usage 1 cells have distinctive bright edges and their interiors are significantly darker than the background.
    The only difference is that background is inhomogeneous and can therefore interfere with segmentation. 
    In this case the cells that lie on the "spot light" are missed by the pipeline from Example Usage 1.
    
    In order to fix that problem we can provide background image which will improve segmentation quality.
2. Pipeline:
    LoadImage
        - input
        - single background for all other input
    IdentifyYeastCells
        - default parameters
        - precision 2
        - background from file
