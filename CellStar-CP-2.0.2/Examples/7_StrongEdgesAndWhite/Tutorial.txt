EXAMPLE USAGE 7
STRONG EDGES AND WHITE CELL INTERIOR:

1. Input imagery features:
    In these images cells have distinctive edges (bright or white) and their interiors are white and similar intensity as the background. Also cell internals are visible which can cause over-segmentation. The general features are quite similar to EXAMPLE USAGE 3 (StrongEdgesAndGray).
    
    It is important to note that although both input images look similar they required different switch state.
    
    The initial parameters may not yield satisfactory results so in order to improve we can use auto-adaptation to find better fitting parameters (see EXAMPLE USAGE 3 for details). 
    
2. Pipelines:
    [StrongEdgesAndWhite_1_Default]
        LoadImage
        IdentifyYeastCells (for bright edges)
            - default parameters
            - precision 2
            - 'Is area without cells brighter than cell interior' set to Yes
        IdentifyYeastCells (for bright edges)
            - default parameters
            - precision 2
            - 'Is area without cells brighter than cell interior' set to No
    
    [StrongEdgesAndWhite_2_Adapted]
        Pipeline with auto-parameters after auto adaptation. Only difference to [StrongEdgesAndWhite_1_Default] is in 'Autoadapted Parameters'.
    
3. Ready to use solution
    The above discussion and pipelines are designed to show how the certain imagery and problems can be approached and solved. However they are not necessarily the best out-of-the-box solution. If you look for a better performing pipeline see _Solution folder.
