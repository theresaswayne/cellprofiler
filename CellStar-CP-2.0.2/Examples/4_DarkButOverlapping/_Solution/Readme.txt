SETUP STEPS:

1. Add images to analyze
2. Set default input path or set path to RulesLogExp.txt file in second FilterObjects module
3. Set default output path - thats where results will appear.
4. Do some image specific parameter tuning (see below).

IMPORTANT TUNING:
- you need to set Average Cell Diameter in IdentifyYeastCells as well as the filtering limits (area of cells to consider)
- prefiltering using Cell.Features.Quality can require tuning as a good value may differer from imagery to imagery
