## Testing nuclear detection and DNA content analysis

The background-corrected integrated intensity ("total intensity") of nuclei should be proportional to DNA content.

The DNA content in a mixed population of actively cycling cells should form a roughly bimodal distribution representing 1N and 2N populations, with some intermediate cells in S phase.

CellProfiler pipelines were used to perform background correction, identify nuclei using DAPI, and measure intensity of DAPI and other channels in a set of 100 images collected on 11-5-2018.

```{r reading DNA data, echo = FALSE}
qbic_C1DNANuclei <- read_csv("~/Google Drive/User projects/Demis qbic/test 2-3/qbic_C1DNANuclei.csv")
#dnaTotalInt <- qbic_C1DNANuclei$Intensity_IntegratedIntensity_Channel1DNA
dnaTotalInt <- qbic_C1DNANuclei$Intensity_IntegratedIntensity_Channel1DNACorr
cat(length(dnaTotalInt),"cells detected.")
```


This is a histogram of the DNA content over all nuclei:

```{r DNA content, echo=TRUE} 
# use echo=FALSE to prevent printing code
hist(dnaTotalInt, breaks = (0:50))
```


The histogram shows that there is a roughly bimodal distribution with peaks ~ 12 and ~ 24, and a long upper tail containing few cells.

```{r proportion of outliers}
low_vals <- mean(dnaTotalInt < 1) * 100
high_vals <- mean(dnaTotalInt > 30) * 100
central_vals <- mean(dnaTotalInt > 1 & dnaTotalInt < 30) * 100

cat(central_vals, "% of the values are between 1 and 30; ",low_vals,"% <1; and",high_vals,"% >30.")
```

Ultimately we would like to see an inverted horseshoe-type plot of EdU (showing S phase cells) vs. DNA content where the cells incorporating EdU are primarily those between the 2 peaks.

Generating the 2nd dimension of the plot from the corrected mean intensity from Channel 2, EdU:
```{r reading EdU data}
#EdUMeanInt <- qbic_C1DNANuclei$Intensity_MeanIntensity_Channel2EdU
EdUMeanInt <- qbic_C1DNANuclei$Intensity_MeanIntensity_Channel2EdUCorr
hist(EdUMeanInt)
plot(x = dnaTotalInt, y = EdUMeanInt) # basic scatter plot
```


Finally, we can look at the mean intensity of gammaH2AX:
```{r reading gH2AX data}
gH2AXMeanInt <- qbic_C1DNANuclei$Intensity_MeanIntensity_Channel3gH2AXCorr
hist(gH2AXMeanInt, breaks = (seq(0.000, 0.050, 0.002)))
```

### Are nuclei detected properly?

Several images were selected at random, and the image of detected objects was compared with the original data. 

False positives (non-cells counted as objects) and false negatives (cells not included in the object map) were scored manually.

```{r reading quality control data, results = 'asis'}
qbic_check <- read_csv("~/github_theresaswayne/cellprofiler/2018-11-15 qbic test 2a.csv")
kable(qbic_check[,(1:5)])
total_cells <- sum(qbic_check$`Cells detected by CP`)
false_pos <- 100 * sum(qbic_check$`False positives`)/total_cells
false_neg <- 100 * sum(qbic_check$`False negatives`)/total_cells
cat("Out of",total_cells,"cells checked, there were",false_pos,"% false positives and",false_neg,"% false negatives.")
```

### How many S-phase cells are EdU-positive, gammaH2AX negative, or both?

S-phase cells were defined based on the histogram as having DNA content between 12 and 24.

EdU-positive cells were defined based on the histogram as having mean intensity >= 0.01.

gH2AX-positive cells were defined based on the histogram as having mean intensity > 0.


```{r EdU and H2AX in S-phase cells}
S_Nuclei <- filter(qbic_C1DNANuclei, Intensity_IntegratedIntensity_Channel1DNACorr > 12 & Intensity_IntegratedIntensity_Channel1DNACorr < 24)
S_EdUMeanInt <- S_Nuclei$Intensity_MeanIntensity_Channel2EdUCorr
S_gH2AXMeanInt <- S_Nuclei$Intensity_MeanIntensity_Channel3gH2AXCorr

plot(x = S_EdUMeanInt, y = S_gH2AXMeanInt) # basic scatter plot
```


## Question: What to do with apparent clumps? 

Some DAPI structures appear to have multiple lobes. Are these multi-lobed nuclei, mitotic cells, or actually multiple cells close together? If needed, we can modify the object detection to split objects by shape.

## Summary

* Time of processing with CellProfiler is < 10 min per 100 images for illumination correction and the same for object detection.
* Nuclei are detected well in this system. There are virtually no false negatives.
* Some bright debris results in false positives, about 2%.
* We need to decide if some objects should be split or if they are actually single nuclei.
